What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?  The customer wanted an application that would allow them to view data on certain courses in their curriculum.  They needed to view individual course information as well as a listing of courses alphabetically ordered.
How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.  This problem was very straight forward.  You need to ensure that every valid course is included and is easily obtainable.  The data structure I used (a hashtable) was easily maintainable while having the versatility to handle an unknown number of courses.  This is important because knowing how to use the datastructure allows you to not only solve the problem but offer enhancement later on.
How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?  To be honest I didnt really encounter any roadblocks on this project.  The most difficult challenge I had was maintaining the loops required to execute the logic in my head.
How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?  Again this project didnt really do much to expand my approach to software development.  I think my years of experience made this project really easy. 
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?  This project hasnt really evolved my understanding of software much.  When looking through code I always try to use descriptive variables, comment as appropriate, and follow best practices of the framework I work with.
